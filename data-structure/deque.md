##Double-ended Queue
A double-ended queue (Deque) is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail). It is also often called a head-tail linked list, though properly this refers to a specific data structure implementation.</br>

###Operations
The basic operations on a deque are enqueue and dequeue on either end. Also generally implemented are peek operations, which return the value at that end without dequeuing it.</br>
Major implementations include:

* insert element at back
* insert element at front
* remove last element
* remove first element
* examine last element
* examine first element
